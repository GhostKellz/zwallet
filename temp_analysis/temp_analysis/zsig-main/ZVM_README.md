# ZVM — The Zig Virtual Machine

`zvm` is a lightweight, modular, and secure virtual machine engine built entirely in Zig. Inspired by the performance and control ethos of Zig, `zvm` is designed to be:

* **Minimal by design** — clean, simple execution engine
* **Customizable** — supports new instruction sets (e.g., zEVM-style bytecode)
* **Secure** — strict memory controls with Zig’s runtime safety
* **Portable** — embeddable in CLIs, nodes, smart wallets, and more

---

## 🧠 Core Objectives

* 🧩 Execute programmable logic: smart contracts, signed scripts, workflows
* 🔐 Run in a sandboxed environment: no external file/network access unless declared
* ⚙️ Support multi-runtime formats: wasm-lite, zvm bytecode, (optional) zEVM subset
* 🧪 Deterministic computation: all operations produce the same result across environments

---

## 🔍 Design Philosophy

`zvm` is not a full blockchain runtime by default — it's a secure execution layer:

* 🛠 **Built for modularity**: easily extendable with custom opcodes
* 🧱 **Memory-constrained**: ideal for edge computing and embedded validation
* 🔄 **State machine-friendly**: integrates well with `zledger` and `zwallet`
* 🔍 **Auditable & deterministic**: encourages formal verification and testing

## 🧰 Architecture

```
┌────────────┐
│  zvm-cli   │  <- local test runner / REPL
└────┬───────┘
     │
┌────▼──────┐
│  zvm-core │  <- bytecode interpreter, stack machine, memory/register state
└────┬──────┘
     │
┌────▼─────────┐
│ zvm-runtime  │  <- plugin functions: storage, signing, I/O hooks
└──────────────┘
```

Optional add-ons:

* `zvm-ledger` (calls into `zledger`)
* `zvm-wallet` (validates against `zsig` signatures)

## 🔁 zEVM Compatibility (Optional)

We may explore compatibility or feature sharing with [`zEVM`](https://github.com/ziglang/zevm):

* EVM opcode set
* Ethereum state machine model
* Potential for full L2 sandbox support in Zig

Unlike `zEVM`, `zvm` aims for:

* More general-purpose VMs (not just Ethereum)
* Smaller, embeddable runtimes (e.g., <100KB for minimal build)
* Purpose-built stack for `ghostchain` and zk-compatible systems

---

## ✨ Features

* Bytecode execution (custom or EVM-like)
* Deterministic gas metering / instruction counting
* Hookable system calls (via `zvm-runtime`)
* WASM-lite compilation target (future)
* Embedded signing + verification (via `zsig`)

---

## Example CLI

```sh
zvm run contract.zvm
zvm verify sig.zsig --payload data.bin
zvm step --instruction
```

---

## 🔐 Use Cases

* Executing governance actions on-chain
* Smart contract testing and replay locally
* Verifying signed payloads in IoT/embedded workflows
* Running deterministic agent logic for `Jarvis`
* Powering programmable logic inside Ghostchain
